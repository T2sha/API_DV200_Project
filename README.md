### Project Description

Welcome to the Formula One Desktop application!
You'll begin to experience your quest for the elusive Full Stack title by seeing a developing a data-driven web application using modern development tools like Node.js and React! This Web Application is investigated by the chosen API of your Formula One, and you will visualize the data collection by seeing the Charts.js framework components being used!

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the latest version of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. The [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) program will also be required.

### How to install

### Installation

<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->
## Features and Functionality

<!-- note how you can use your gitHub link. Just make a path to your assets folder -->

### All The Latest Formula One Data! 

Using the Formula One API, we have collected and collated all the most relevant Formula One  data into once seemless react experience!

### Feature 2

PROPS are react objects that store the values of a tag's attributes and behave similarly to HTML attributes. It allows data to be passed from one component to another. It's the same as function parameters. Props are provided to the component in the same way as function arguments are. As seen in the above Mockup, using PROPS in a tableItem style ,different Formula One drivers with their gain points are displayed.
